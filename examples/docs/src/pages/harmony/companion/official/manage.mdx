# Managing A Validator
Notes on the managing a validator section
## Managing Notes
There's not much to go over on this section as it just shows you commands for management. This wraps up getting your validator online. You're signing blocks and good to go now, right?
## Adding A Validator Logo
If you add a logo via the --identity command while creating a validator or send one later via edit-validator the logo may not be active on the Testnet pages but it's working.
