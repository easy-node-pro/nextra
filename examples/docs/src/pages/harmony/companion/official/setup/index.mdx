# Hardware Requirements
Hardware requirements from the official guide and our notes.
- Choose from a [regular Ubuntu server](/harmony/companion/official/hardware/standard) or a [Raspberry Pi](/harmony/companion/official/hardware/rasppi) for your node.

## Server Requirements
Here's the current recommended hardware from Harmony Foundation:

Here's our recommendations today:
- Bare metal server rental (no shared VPS)
- CPU - 8 dedicated CPUs
- Memory - 16GB should work but 32GB+ is recommeneded
- Disk - NvME disks
- OS - Ubuntu 20.04/22.04LTS
- Network - 1GBPS+ bandwidth with at least 6TB> month cap (uncapped best for instabilitiy of the network)
- Providers - We no longer recommend Digital Ocean, Vultr, AWS, GCP or Azure as they are not sufficient or too expensive
## Storage
Before we talk about providers let's discuss storage. Make sure you have enough space as we're currently adding over 300GB a month due to transaction increases.

Digital Ocean has the option to use "Volumes" that can be [easily expanded](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/volumes/how-to/increase-size/) when more space is required to help with cost savings.
