## Harmony Future Improvements
Here's a list of future things that could be worked on or added to harmony-toolbox if you have time!  

- BLS Key management is complex and we're not sure if it can be coded in at this point without liability but we'll be proposing this as a project soon!  
- Create, Add, Remove, although we'll have to add a lot of annoying messages about backing them up to your home machine.  
- Web management interface that runs locally and only you can access to get stats and manage your server.  
- Help menu when using -h
